## Short Description

In this project, I implemented a dynamic table where we can add rows, columns and also can remove them as well.

### Features & Functionalities

- There are 4 buttons for adding row, adding column, removing row, and removing column from the table.

- Clicking on the Add Row button adds a row in the table.

- Clicking on the Add Column button adds a column in the table where the column name is taken from the input field.

- Clicking on the Delete button for will remove the corresponding row from the table.

- Clicking on the Remove Column button removes the corresponding column from the table.

- Technology: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript, Bootstrap 5.
